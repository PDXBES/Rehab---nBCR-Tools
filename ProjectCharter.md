# Vision for Success #
This is how we see our contribution to this project being successful (adapted from the Agile Manifesto):
  * Ensure early and continuous delivery of documented, valuable results that can be reviewed and evaluated against the requirements of the permit
  * Work closely with Sponsor to develop the interim results so there are no surprises in �The End"
  * Use the documented results as the primary measure of progress
  * Ensure continuous attention to technical excellence
  * Welcome changing requirements from Sponsor, even late in the development of the work, as long as impacts to schedule, budget, and quality are clearly conveyed, understood, and approved by Sponsor
  * Build projects around motivated individuals, giving them the support and environment they need, and trust them to get the job done, which will ensure that a sustainable work environment is maintained
  * Support face-to-face conversation as the most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within the team

# Management Process #

Agile with SCRUM framework has been used successfully in many software development projects. For it to work at BES, we need to have 100% of the resources during the Sprints. At each sprint, we can determine whether a resource will be needed that week, but attendance is required for each weekly sprint review.

{Detail Needed} is the Product Owner. {Detail Needed} is the SCRUM Master. Everyone else is the DEVELOPMENT TEAM.

Communication and management will be facilitated by the following:

  * **SPRINT** - time boxed burst of activity that marks a "mini-phase" of development. Though these can be up to 30 days in duration, for the tight time frame of this project, they will be between 1-2 weeks in duration.
  * **SPRINT Planning Meeting** - Longer meeting (up to 1 hour) at the beginning of each SPRINT. It consists of two parts:
    * What will be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?
    * How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?
  * **Daily SCRUM** - short meeting (15 minutes) for the DEVELOPMENT team and Mark. It is meant to deal with:
    * What has been accomplished since the last Daily SCRUM?
    * What will be done before the next Daily SCRUM?
    * What obstacles are in the way?
  * **SPRINT Review Meeting** -
    * The Product Owner identifies (from the DEV TEAMS report) what has been "Done" and what has not been "Done";
    * The Development Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it ran into, and how those problems were solved;
    * The Development Team demonstrates the work that it has “Done” and answers questions about the Increment;
    * The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands. He or she projects likely completion dates based on progress to date; and,
    * The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review provides valuable input to subsequent Sprint Planning Meetings.
