The code's purpose is to assist in completing a comprehensive condition assessment and rehabilitation plan for the City of Portland's combined and sanitary sewer systems, to be incorporated into the System Plan Update (the Stormwater System Plan to follow). This coding project documents existing and revised business practices for future use, as well as provides SQL Server code used for analysis.  BES will use the prototype code developed here for inclusion into business practices targeting future rehabilitation planning/engineering processes.
