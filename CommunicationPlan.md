<h3>What this is</h3>
Detail Needed<br>
This document will lay out the primary elements of the communication plan for the development effort. By default, as much of the communication that occurs is done via documents, this will also serve as an abridged document management plan as well.<br>
<br>
<h3>Why we need it</h3>
The primary task of any SCRUM team is to communicate with one another in a fluid way, while at the same time capturing the flow of decision making and progression towards deliverable products.  For this to work, each team member needs to contribute to that flow.  A partial list of when communication is vital during a SCRUM is when:<br>
<ul><li>New ideas, including product backlog and owner objectives are being discussed or developed<br>
</li><li>Clarification is being sought<br>
</li><li>New vernacular is being adopted<br>
</li><li>Questions need to be answered<br>
</li><li>Decisions are being made<br>
</li><li>Workflow is being coordinated</li></ul>

<h3>What it involves</h3>
Each of these events should trigger some type of communication within the team in order to keep individual assumptions to a minimum.  As a SCRUM usually consists of fast-paced, time-boxed work efforts (SPRINTS) through a much larger project, capturing or facilitating these communication events usually involve a number of tools and methods which should be scaled to each SPRINT while allowing for the accumulation of the progression of ideas and developments across the project.  Such tools and methods include:<br>
<ul><li>Meetings<br>
</li><li>Brief (though perhaps many) Technical Memos<br>
</li><li>Flow charts<br>
</li><li>Bug/issue reports<br>
</li><li>E-mails<br>
</li><li>Verbal communications<br>
</li><li>Sticky notes<br>
</li><li>Comments in code<br>
</li><li>Project coordination tools (i.e. Trello board, Wiki, etc.)<br>
Thankfully, most SCRUMs involve relatively small teams (typically no more than 9) so though the types of communication methods employed may be varied, the volume and bandwidth of that communication is often limited due to the small number of individuals involved.  However, there are times where there will be communication "surges".</li></ul>

<h3>When it matters</h3>
Within a SCRUM, there are times when communication needs to be more frequent and other times where it will scale down.  During a SCRUM, most "formal" communication occurs during:<br>
<ul><li>Project initiation/chartering<br>
</li><li>Development of project backlog<br>
</li><li>SPRINT review meetings<br>
</li><li>SPRINT planning meetings<br>
</li><li>SPRINT retrospectives<br>
</li><li>Daily SPRINT standup meetings<br>
</li><li>Intra-team, day-to-day communications</li></ul>

<a href='http://wiki.besasm-meta.googlecode.com/hg/WhenItMattersGraph.PNG'>http://wiki.besasm-meta.googlecode.com/hg/WhenItMattersGraph.PNG</a><div>The list presents SCRUM events in a more or less top-down order, with those events at the top likely involving the most need for communication to be captured. Communication is needed most at any transition, either between phases or SPRINTS.  There is also a high volume of communication required for product reviews by the owner.  These usually come at the end of a SPRINT, but they can occur within a SPRINT should interim products, such as TM's needing review, be needed.<br>
<br>
<h3>How it is managed</h3>
Agile with SCRUM framework has been used successfully in many software development projects. For it to work at BES, we need to have 100% of the resources during the Sprints.  At each Sprint, we can determine whether a resource will be needed 100% for that Sprint, but attendance is required for each sprint review.<div>Gary is the Product Owner.  Mark is the SCRUM Master.  Everyone else is the DEVELOPMENT TEAM.<div>Communication and management will be facilitated by the following:<br>
<ul><li><b>SPRINT</b> - time - boxed burst of activity that marks a "mini-phase" of development.  Though these can be up to 30 days in duration, for the tight time frame of this project, they will be between 1-2 weeks in duration.<br>
</li><li><b>SPRINT Planning Meeting</b> - Longer meeting (up to 1 hour) at the beginning of each SPRINT.  It consists of two parts:<br>
<ul><li>What will be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?<br>
</li><li>How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?<br>
</li></ul></li><li><b>Daily SCRUM Standup</b> - Daily standups are meant to be a quick overview of past daily progress, current daily goals, and any obstacles.  These are scheduled at the same time each day, preferably toward the beginning of the day.  As not everyone can attend every meeting, if a short list of activities can be e-mailed to the daily standup note taker (usually the SCRUM master - Mark) he will include them in the daily meeting notes.  This is a short meeting (15 minutes) for the DEVELOPMENT team and Mark.  It is meant to deal with:<br>
<ul><li>What has been accomplished since the last Daily SCRUM?<br>
</li><li>What will be done before the next Daily SCRUM?<br>
</li><li>What obstacles are in the way?<br>
</li></ul></li><li><b>SPRINT Review Meeting</b> - this meeting is held with the entire team, including the Product Owner. The purpose of this review meeting is present 'products' from the previous Sprint and review issues, schedule, business case, and more.<br>
<ul><li>The Product Owner identifies (from the DEV TEAMS report) what has been "Done" and what has not been "Done";<br>
</li><li>The Development Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it ran into, and how those problems were solved;<br>
</li><li>The Development Team demonstrates the work that it has "Done" and answers questions about the Increment;<br>
</li><li>The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands. He or she projects likely completion dates based on progress to date; and,<br>
</li><li>The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review provides valuable input to subsequent Sprint Planning Meetings.<br>
</li></ul></li><li><b>SPRINT Retrospective</b> - the purpose of this meeting is to look back at the previous Sprint, discuss the process and experience, and determine possible improvements for the next Sprint.<br>
<ul><li>Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools;<br>
</li><li>Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements; and,<br>
</li><li>Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work.<br>

<h3>How to track tasks</h3>
This project will use TRELLO to track tasks.  All team members are asked to update their tasks in TRELLO on a regular basis.<div><a href='https://trello.com/'>https://trello.com/</a><div><i>Or go to trello.com and login using your google account</i>

<h3>How and why to document</h3>
<h4>Project Directory</h4>
The project directory is located at <code>\\Cassio\{Detail Needed}</code>. All documents should be stored on this directory. All work should be done in this directory. As products are completed, forward them to Neil for posting on the Wiki.<br>
<h4>Project Wiki</h4>
The project Wiki is located at <a href='http://code.google.com/p/besasm-{Detail'>http://code.google.com/p/besasm-{Detail</a> Needed}.<div>All documents should be sent to Neil Revello for uploading to the Wiki.  If possible, keep formatting to a minimum. However, Neil can modify formatting as needed. The Wiki will be useful for version control as well as making the documents more accessible.  OBSTACLES should be tracked on the Wiki.<br>
<h4>Document Templates</h4>
Templates for documents are loaded in <code>\\oberon\GRP117\Microsoft Office Templates\ASM</code>.<br>
<h4>File Naming Conventions</h4>
All files shall have a meaningful enough label to differentiate it from other documents.  Most should include a date stamp (YYYYMMDD) for versioning sake (ie. Meetingnotes_20120405.doc)<br>
<h4>Documentation of Meetings</h4>
For the SCIP SCRUM, meetings come in several varieties.  Someone should be designated note taker for each meeting, and any meeting notes (in whatever form is available) should be placed in the appropriate project directory, under the appropriate Phase and SPRINT.  For example, for Phase 1/SPRINT 1 the corresponding root of the meeting documentation would be:<div>\\Cassio\systems_planning\SCIP\Phase_1\Documents\SPRINT_ONE\meetings<div>There should be a sub-directory for every transition (i.e. SPRINTPLAN) or main information gathering (i.e. DRIVERS) meeting, as seen below.  Some meetings that occur in groups, such as the stand ups, should be in their own directory, following the same basic naming convention as the sub-directories.<br>
<br>
<a href='http://wiki.besasm-meta.googlecode.com/hg/DirectoryStructureSCIP.PNG'>http://wiki.besasm-meta.googlecode.com/hg/DirectoryStructureSCIP.PNG</a>

If possible, meeting notes should be typed up, but if time is of the essence and one's hand written notes are legible, scans of notes will suffice.
