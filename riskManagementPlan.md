| RISK | IMPACT | EARLY INDICATORS OF IMPACTS | WHAT CAN TEAM DO? | WHAT CAN PM DO? | WHAT DOES PM NEED FROM SPONSOR? | Current Assessment of Likelihood |
|:-----|:-------|:----------------------------|:------------------|:----------------|:--------------------------------|:---------------------------------|
|Team members pulled off by upper managers during a sprint cycle to do higher priority work. | Schedule will NOT be met or products will be deficient | Sprint cycle products not complete. | Alert PM at sprint standup meetings that this is an obstacle. Keep workload on Trello board as up to date as much as possible.  Help PM understand the impacts to product delivery intended for the end of sprint. | Alert Sponsor to the risk (at the Sprint Planning meeting-with visuals and products, it will be easier to prove the point); Discuss with Sponsor the limitations on team members to be able to manage this risk.  Bring in tools to help point out "pinch points" (i.e. the Trello workload board) | Mark has said schedule is important.  Ask Mark to work with Virgil on keeping a certain commitment for the team at least during each sprint (doesn't have to be 100%- but may for certain staff during a specific sprint) | Very High |
| Upper management does not understand the principles behind Agile with SCRUM. | Schedule may NOT be met or products will be deficient | "Team members pulled off and sprint cycle products not complete. Team will be less agreeable to try this management method in future.  Momentum is lost as team needs to quickly regroup, which given the pace of the work is a big impact." | See note above | "Continue to inform upper management (Virgil and Mark for this) about the framework we have in place and our expectations for its support to ensure success - doing that already but keep on keeping on.  Bring in an outside teacher who can explain principles of Agile, basics of SCRUM (good way to earn PDU's also).  Also introduce tools consistent with SPRINTS and kanban - like our proposed Trello launch for the entire group for workload management." | "Mark has experience with standup meetings.  Mark talk to Virgil about benefit of this framework, and how effective it can be." | Very High |
| Team members not fully understanding the principles behind Agile and the framework of SCRUM. | "May not fully embrace the opportunity, or may get discouraged when pulled off in the middle of a sprint." | Scared to make commitments?  (this hasn't been our experience yet) | Request training | Bring in trainer/ buy books/push websites/infuse language and concepts to team on a daily basis through heavy face time contacts. | "Continue to improve understanding of the AGILE approach, and thus offer support where possible." | Low |
